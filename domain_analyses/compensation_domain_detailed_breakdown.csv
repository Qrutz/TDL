P01,Q7_explain,Low pay rates,"below_minimum_wage; inconsistent_payment; effort_pay_mismatch; unpaid_work; unpaid_qualifications",Y,"Most tasks pay below minimum wage when you factor in the time it takes to complete them carefully. Payment is inconsistent—some tasks pay fairly for the effort, but many underpay or require extra unpaid work like qualifications or reviews."
P01,Q12_challenges,Effort-pay mismatch,"unfair_pay; inconsistent_payment",Y,"The biggest challenges include unfair and unpredictable pay, frequent task rejections without clear reasons, lack of transparency about how work is evaluated, and exposure to disturbing content without adequate support. There's also emotional strain from the repetitive nature of the work and pressure to work quickly, which can affect quality and well-being. Platforms often lack proper communication and meaningful feedback."
P02,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,stable_fair_pay,N,"The pay is stable and fair"
P03,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,,N,"the tasks are usually very quick and simple"
P03,Q9_followup,Effort-pay mismatch,unfair_pay,Y,"the survey was unfairly rejecting participants based on attention checks that were not allowed under the platform's rules"
P04,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,,N,"it is a good pay"
P05,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,time_effort_reflection,N,"According to the time i spend doing the work i feel fairly compensated"
P05,Q12_challenges,Positive compensation experience,,N,"I have never had any problems"
P06,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,,N,"I dont accept the tasks because the work is too much for little pay"
P07,Q7_explain,Low pay rates,below_minimum_wage,Y,"Estimates are typically inaccurate for how long particular tasks take to complete. Even the stated pay per task is roughly minimum wage or less in a lot of cases."
P07,Q12_challenges,Low pay rates,,Y,"There have been really no challenges or ethical concerns that I have encountered as a data annotator, other than generally low pay rates."
P08,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,,N,"Payment varies by requestor but generally feels fair for the task being required for completion"
P09,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,time_effort_reflection,Y,"I feel fairly compensated because the payment reflects the time and effort required for each task. The wage varies appropriately based on task complexity, more complex tasks offer higher pay, which makes sense and feels balanced."
P09,Q12_challenges,Effort-pay mismatch,"effort_pay_mismatch; time_effort_reflection",Y,"As a data annotator, one of the biggest challenges is the lack of fair pay relative to the effort required , especially on crowd-sourced platforms. Some tasks are time-consuming or mentally taxing, such as labeling complex images or transcribing unclear audio—but the compensation doesn't always reflect that effort."
P10,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,,N,"some task requires a lot of effort as compared to the compensation offered"
P10,Q12_challenges,General compensation issues,,N,"payments issues"
P11,Q7_explain,General compensation issues,,N,"$3 for a task that takes 35 minutes with content that needs you to be very attentive, is too low."
P11,Q12_challenges,Effort-pay mismatch,,N,"The payment is just not fair for the amount of work I do."
P12,Q7_explain,General compensation issues,,N,"Always could get more"
P12,Q11_describe,Low pay rates,,N,"Payment seems poor at timed"
P13,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,,N,"stable"

P14,Q12_challenges,Effort-pay mismatch,unfair_pay,N,"Unfair payment, underestimated required time"
P15,Q7_explain,Low pay rates,,N,"For beer money"
P15,Q12_challenges,Positive compensation experience,,N,"I did not have any ethical concern"
P16,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,,N,"i feel the amount of time spent for my output to be quality is not commensurate with the pay"
P16,Q12_challenges,General compensation issues,,N,"violation of regulatory rules"
P17,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,effort_pay_mismatch,N,"Many tasks takes long durtion to complete and does pay less amount than needed"
P18,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,,N,"I feel that it requires more focus and time therefore it should be compensated accordingly"
P19,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,,Y,"Payment is good and fair also the longer you take the more payment you get which is good for tasks that are well explained and easy to do"
P19,Q12_challenges,Low pay rates,,N,"There's pressure to work fast for low pay which can cause stress"
P20,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,time_effort_reflection,N,"The pay matches the time and work I have to complete"
P20,Q12_challenges,Positive compensation experience,,N,"Haven't yet"
P21,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,time_effort_reflection,N,"I feel the payment is very fair for the time I spend doing the study"
P22,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,time_effort_reflection,N,"The payment mostly matches the amount of time needed on the task."
P22,Q12_challenges,Effort-pay mismatch,,N,"Time consuming and underpaying. Repetitive questions."
P23,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,time_effort_reflection,Y,"The payment depends on the type of tasks and the time required to do them and the tasks are fairly good and the payment is appropriate"
P24,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,time_effort_reflection,N,"I feels like the time I spend on surveys is worth it"
P25,Q7_explain,General compensation issues,,N,"not sure what is the standard across for payment."
P25,Q9_followup,Effort-pay mismatch,unfair_pay,Y,"The task was very long, and after I had finished, it was rejected on the basis that it did not reach the required number of corrections or right answers. That was unfair to me because I spent a lot of time, and the task was very tedious."
P25,Q12_challenges,Effort-pay mismatch,,N,"Nothing much currently. Some can be tedious for a small amount of payment."
P26,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,"effort_pay_mismatch; time_effort_reflection",N,"Some tasks require a lot lot of effort and time but pay vey little"
P27,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,time_effort_reflection,N,"I BELIEVE I;M FAIRLY COMPENSATED DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME I SPEND ON EACH PROJECT"
P27,Q12_challenges,Positive compensation experience,,N,"HONESTLY THERE ARE NONE"
P28,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,,Y,"Some tasks are well compensated and others not so much. I think it is usually to do with the platform and type of work I do. However, sometimes the work is quite tedious and time consuming but the pay is low."
P29,Q7_explain,Payment volatility,inconsistent_payment,N,"unpredictable"
P30,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,,Y,"For some tasks one may take much more time to finish the task because it will be longer than the time given"
P31,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,,N,"Some tasks are too long compared to the amount that is being paid for it."
P32,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,stable_fair_pay,N,"Pretty consistent generally"
P33,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,time_effort_reflection,N,"It depends, but sometimes what you get isn't worth the time and effort required."
P34,Q7_explain,Payment volatility,inconsistent_payment,N,"This instability makes it difficult to rely on data labeling as a consistent source of income."
P34,Q12_challenges,Positive compensation experience,,N,"no"
P35,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,"effort_pay_mismatch; time_effort_reflection",Y,"Time vs. Pay: If I were paid per task, the amount of time it takes to complete each one would be a huge factor. Many data labeling tasks can be time-consuming, especially when they require high accuracy. If the pay rate doesn't scale with time or effort, it could be hard to meet basic needs on that alone."
P36,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,,Y,"The tasks are relatively quick or easy compared to the amount paid. You can do them in flexible hours, possibly stacking with other income streams."
P38,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,"inconsistent_payment; effort_pay_mismatch; time_effort_reflection",Y,"Honestly speaking, the pay doesn't always match the effort. Some tasks take a lot of time to understand and complete carefully, but the payment ends up being really low especially when you break it down hourly. Overall, it feels like a lot of work for not much reward, and the pay is pretty unpredictable."
P39,Q7_explain,General compensation issues,,N,", Payment, and Pay Stability"
P40,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,"effort_pay_mismatch; time_effort_reflection",Y,"When assessing tasks, consider the time and effort required, compare potential compensation across different tasks, and evaluate the perceived stability of payment. Understanding these factors can help individuals make informed decisions about their work and financial well-being."
P41,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,,N,"it feels stable payment are satisfied"
P41,Q12_challenges,Positive compensation experience,,N,"none"
P42,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,,N,"good"
P42,Q12_challenges,Positive compensation experience,,N,"none"
P44,Q7_explain,Positive compensation experience,stable_fair_pay,Y,"I think I average about 10–15 hours a week. This is my side hustle, so that's the perfect balance for me."
P45,Q7_explain,General compensation issues,,Y,"Gather the basics for each task Time per unit: how long it takes to complete one unit/task (minutes or hours). Pay per unit: how much you earn for one unit. Overheads: travel, materials, software, setup, cleanup, taxes, etc. (any extra time/money you must spend beyond the core task). Frequency/volume: how many units you can realistically complete in a given period (hour/day/week). Payment timing/reliability: how often you're paid and how certain the payout is (e.g., weekly direct deposit vs. after project completion)."
P46,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,"inconsistent_payment; effort_pay_mismatch; time_effort_reflection",Y,"The tasks often take more time and effort than the payment reflects. Some tasks are straightforward, but others are complex or repetitive, and pay doesn't always match the work involved. Payment can also be inconsistent across different tasks or projects."
P47,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,inconsistent_payment,Y,"On Amazon MTurk, many tasks take longer than expected compared to their listed pay, making the effective hourly rate low. Some payment can feel unpredictable since some requesters reject work without clear reasons, affecting stability."
P48,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,"inconsistent_payment; effort_pay_mismatch; time_effort_reflection",Y,"Pay on Amazon Mechanical Turk often feels unpredictable because the time and effort required for tasks can vary greatly while payment rates don't always reflect the work involved."
P49,Q7_explain,Effort-pay mismatch,effort_pay_mismatch,N,"Because effort often outweighs pay and rates are unstable."
P50,Q7_explain,General compensation issues,,Y,"f you're weighing tasks, here's a practical framework to compare them by time/effort, pay, and how predictable the pay is. It helps you decide which tasks to focus on. Gather the basics for each task Time per unit: how long it takes to complete one unit/task (minutes or hours). Pay per unit: how much you earn for one unit. Overheads: travel, materials, software, setup, cleanup, taxes, etc. (any extra time/money you must spend beyond the core task). Frequency/volume: how many units you can realistically complete in a given period (hour/day/week).
