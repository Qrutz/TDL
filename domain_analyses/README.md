# Domain-Specific Analyses

This folder contains detailed analyses for each of the six domains identified in the study. Each domain has three types of files:

## File Types

### Complete Analysis (`*_domain_complete_analysis.csv`)
- **Subtheme breakdown**: Count, percentage, distinct participants, quote candidates
- **Code breakdown**: Count, percentage, distinct participants, quote candidates  
- **Total statistics**: Overall domain prevalence and participant counts

### Detailed Breakdown (`*_domain_detailed_breakdown.csv`)
- **Complete participant-level data**: All responses for each domain
- **Full coding information**: Subthemes, codes, quote candidates
- **Participant IDs**: For traceability and verification

### Summary Analysis (`*_domain_summary_analysis.md`)
- **Comprehensive interpretation**: Key findings and patterns
- **Representative quotes**: Illustrative examples from each subtheme
- **Statistical summaries**: Prevalence and distribution analysis

### 6. Platform Reliability & Access (10% prevalence)
- **Key subthemes**: Technical reliability issues (8%), platform access problems (2%)
- **Key codes**: technical_issues (6%), system_errors (6%), platform_issues (2%)

## Usage

These files provide:
- **Complete transparency** in the analysis process
- **Reproducible results** with full data breakdowns
- **Detailed insights** for each domain
- **Quote candidates** for manuscript writing
- **Statistical verification** of all claims

## Data Integrity

All analyses are based on the coded qualitative data in `../data/02_coded_qualitative_data.csv` and maintain full traceability to participant responses.
