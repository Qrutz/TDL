P02,Q12_challenges,Time pressure and constraints,work_pressure,N,"it is just the pressure which is manageable"
P04,Q12_challenges,Time pressure and constraints,"work_pressure; time_constraints",N,"sometime there is pressure to some timed task"
P06,Q12_challenges,Task design challenges,time_constraints,N,"drawn out work with no time table"
P08,Q12_challenges,Task design challenges,work_pressure,Y,"I have not really experienced any significant challenges to the work, mainly it is a little dull and mundane so maintaining focus can be issue on batch tasks. I have had no ethical concerns at all."
P12,Q9_followup,Task design challenges,time_constraints,N,"Time out"
P12,Q12_challenges,Task design challenges,time_constraints,N,"Platform doesn't care if something times out and your spend hours doing tasks"
P20,Q9_followup,Task design challenges,time_constraints,N,"The task just didn't stop and went over the allotted time, I contacted the researcher but no reply."
P21,Q12_challenges,Task design challenges,time_constraints,N,"By not receiving the same study anymore"
P22,Q9_followup,Task design challenges,time_constraints,N,"A task was timed out due to connectivity issues and I was not compensated due to the fact that the task had a time allocation."
P23,Q12_challenges,Task design challenges,time_constraints,N,"Sometimes the task given is too long and you have to finish it in one go"
P26,Q12_challenges,Task design challenges,time_constraints,N,"Some researchers can give you a very long task but give you a very short time to complete it"
P28,Q12_challenges,Task design challenges,time_constraints,Y,"I think the biggest strain is when projects or tasks are released, there is no set time. You feel that you have to be online long enough in order to get your piece of the pie. Its like a competition with other fellow workers. Which can play havoc to sleep. Also, the paranoid of been banned or shadow banned when your dashboard has no work. And they is no recourse on why, or is it because there is no work and it is rather annoying especially if you need the work to help with finances."
P31,Q9_followup,Task design challenges,time_constraints,N,"The researcher said that I had exceeded the average time to finish the study hence rejecting it. I simply asked to return it and I was never paid for it"
P35,Q12_challenges,Instruction clarity issues,"task_complexity; guideline_issues",Y,"One of the most significant challenges in data labeling is ensuring that the work is fair and unbiased. When annotating content for AI models, there's a risk of inadvertently reinforcing bias. For example, if data is labeled based on human judgments or cultural assumptions, it might skew the model to be more biased toward one group over another. The responsibility of making sure that every dataset is as unbiased as possible would be on the annotator, but the guidelines for labeling might not always provide clarity on how to navigate complex situations."
P38,Q9_followup,Instruction clarity issues,"time_constraints; instruction_issues",N,"Yes, I've had tasks rejected a few times, and it's really frustrating especially when I felt like I followed the instructions exactly. Sometimes no reason is given at all, or it's just a vague note like low quality without explaining what was wrong. Sometimes I sent email but they not response."
P44,Q9_followup,Task design challenges,time_constraints,N,"Actually I dont know. May be my fault , or task done but time over but unable to submit the code into Mturk."
