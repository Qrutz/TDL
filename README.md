# Data Annotation Worker Experience Study

This repository contains the complete analysis and findings from a survey of 50 data annotation workers across multiple platforms, examining their working conditions, challenges, and suggested improvements.

## Repository Structure

### üìä `data/`
Core datasets used in the analysis:
- `01_raw_survey_data.csv` - Raw survey responses (N=50)
- `02_coded_qualitative_data.csv` - Coded qualitative responses by domain
- `03_improvement_suggestions.csv` - Worker-suggested improvements (RQ2)
- `04_rq1_domain_statistics.csv` - Domain prevalence statistics
- `05_rq1_subtheme_statistics.csv` - Subtheme prevalence statistics

### üìä `charts/`
Essential visualizations:
- 10 key charts showing domain prevalence, subthemes, and patterns
- `README.md` - Chart descriptions and methodology

### üìù `manuscript/`
Research paper sections:
- `resultssection.tex` - Complete results section with domain-by-domain analysis
- `Discussion.tex` - Discussion and interpretation of findings

### üîç `domain_analyses/`
Detailed domain-specific analyses:
- **Compensation & Economic Security**: Complete analysis, detailed breakdown, summary
- **Transparency & QA**: Complete analysis, detailed breakdown, summary  
- **Content Exposure & Emotional Load**: Complete analysis, detailed breakdown, summary
- **Support & Dispute Resolution**: Complete analysis, detailed breakdown, summary
- **Task Design & Time Pressure**: Complete analysis, detailed breakdown, summary
- **Platform Reliability & Access**: Complete analysis, detailed breakdown, summary

## Key Findings

### Domain Prevalence (RQ1)
1. **Compensation & Economic Security**: 98% of workers
2. **Transparency & QA**: 88% of workers
3. **Content Exposure & Emotional Load**: 72% of workers
4. **Support & Dispute Resolution**: 36% of workers
5. **Task Design & Time Pressure**: 30% of workers
6. **Platform Reliability & Access**: 10% of workers

### Worker-Suggested Improvements (RQ2)
1. **Compensation mechanics**: 62% of workers
2. **Process legibility**: 18% of workers
3. **Support/appeals**: 10% of workers
4. **Task design**: 6% of workers
5. **Content safeguards**: 4% of workers
6. **Platform reliability**: 0% of workers

## Methodology

- **Sample**: 50 data annotation workers across multiple platforms
- **Analysis**: Hybrid thematic analysis with deductive domain coding
- **Platforms**: Prolific, Amazon Mechanical Turk, Remotasks, Outlier AI, Appen, Scale AI
- **Regions**: North America (44%), Africa (28%), Europe (20%), Oceania (2%), Other (6%)

## Key Insights

1. **Compensation Paradox**: 64% report fair task-level compensation, but 44% state income doesn't meet basic needs
2. **Platform Variation**: Significant differences in transparency and support across platforms
3. **Content Exposure**: 48% report disturbing content exposure with varied emotional impacts
4. **Actionable Solutions**: Workers prioritize researcher-level changes over platform-level issues

## Usage
